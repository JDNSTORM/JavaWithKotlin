# JavaWithKotlin

This is a demonstration of an Android Java Project with Kotlin Code.
You can see that despite being different languages, Java and Kotlin can work together.
Java can use Kotlin Objects and Kotlin can use Java objects vice versa.
It is interoperable and convenient despite the language barrier.
